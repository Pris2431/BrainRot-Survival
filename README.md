### Customization

You can easily modify the look of the game by editing the following:

- **Health and Aura Bars**: Customize colors and widths in the `progress-bar` and `progress` classes in `styles.css`.
- **Fonts & Layout**: Play around with font styles and layout in `styles.css`.

## Code Explanation

### HTML

  - **`.left-section`** for questions and options.
  - **`.right-section`** to show your character and stats (Health and Aura).

### CSS

- **`styles.css`** handles the gameâ€™s visual design:
  - Button effects, fonts, layout, colors, and animations.
  - The character's image is styled in a circular frame with the `.character` class.

  - Handles the logic when you select an answer.
  - Increases or decreases Health and Aura based on whether the answer is correct or wrong.
